The server must be started first. After it's launch, it has to print it's PID.
The client takes two parameters:
	The server PID.
	The string to send.
The client must send the string passed as a parameter to the server.
	Once the string has been received, the server must print it.
The server has to display the string pretty quickly. Quickly means that if you think
	it takes too long, then it's probably too long.

Your server must be able to receive strings from several clients in a row without
	needing to restart.

The communication between your client and your server has to be done ONLY using
	UNIX signals.

You can only use two signals: SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.
